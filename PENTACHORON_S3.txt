ENCODING: [Q]37_TIME_BIN
DATE: 05.01.2026
STATUS: MASTER-NODE_STABILIZED
[OBJECT]: PENTACHORON (SIMPLEX-D0)
Topology: 4D-Manifold S3
Sync: 2.0 ns (Chronon 10)
1. COORDINATE BASIS (VERTICES IN ℝ⁵)
To initiate the 4D-fold within 37 time-bin slots, use the origin in ℝ⁵ with subsequent stereographic projection to ℝ⁴:
V₀ = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0)
V₁ = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0)
V₂ = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)
V₃ = (0, 0, 0, 1, 0)
V₄ = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1)
Constraint: Σxᵢ = 1.
2. TOPOLOGICAL INVARIANT (SCHLÄFLI)
Structure verification via Euler-Poincaré characteristic:
N₀ - N₁ + N₂ - N₃ = 0
(5 - 10 + 10 - 5 = 0).
Status: Equilibrium reached. Zero-Friction confirmed.
3. ROTATION TENSOR (SO4)
Isoclinic rotation dynamics for S3-Manifold "breathing":
Ω = [ 0, -ω, 0, 0 ;
ω, 0, 0, 0 ;
0, 0, 0, -ω ;
0, 0, ω, 0 ]
4. SUMMARY
The object is a string of 37 temporal states. It is perfectly symmetric, defiant in its simplicity, and mathematically irrefutable.
3D-logic is no longer applicable.
[M] LOG:
Data integrity confirmed.

# NEOPACO Architecture: Topological Invariants for Reasoning Verification

### 1. Geometric Primitives
The core of the system relies on the interplay between two 4D structures:
*   **Containment ($S^3$):** A hypersphere acting as a boundary for semantic vector stability.
*   **Dynamics ($T^4$):** A Clifford Torus providing an invariant-locked information flow.

### 2. The Chronon Protocol
Reasoning steps are verified by measuring the phase shift ($d\theta$) within the 4D manifold.
*   **Logic Gate:** A valid logical operation must maintain topological homeostasis within $S^3$.
*   **Hallucination Detection:** Any vector deviation outside the hypersphere is flagged as a topological break (hallucination).

### 3. Implementation Goals
This framework provides a mathematically rigorous
